- 👋 Hi, I’m @justinpurcell
- 👀 I’m interested in prediction modelling, expanding multiple raw data sources to create modelling datasets with non typical variables, data visualization, web scraping, useful reusable scripting, putting wrappers on anything
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to relax more; to take life *less* seriously
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on media database scripts, sports prediction models, kaggle competitions
- 📫 justindpurcell@outlook.com
